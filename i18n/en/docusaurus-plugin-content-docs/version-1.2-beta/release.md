# Changelog

## 🎉 V1.2 Beta
APIPark introduces a brand-new AI Service (AI Gateway) feature, supporting the quick integration of multiple AI models to help developers rapidly incorporate and call various AI models. APIPark simplifies the calling process through a unified API format, reducing the complexity of switching models, and supports packaging Prompts into standard REST APIs for easy reuse and sharing. APIPark supports complete API lifecycle management, including design, release, invocation, and decommissioning, and also provides a subscription approval mechanism to enhance data security.

🦄 APIPark is now on ProductHunt:
